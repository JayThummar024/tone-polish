# Tone Polish AI Assistant

A lightweight internal tool that helps customer support agents rewrite rough messages into a **professional, empathetic, and concise tone**.
Built with **Spring Boot (Java)** for backend and **React** for frontend, with a mock AI service that can be swapped with OpenAI later.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot
* **Frontend:** React (Hooks, modular components)
* **Testing:** JUnit (backend), React Testing Library (frontend)
* **AI Mock:** Service layer returns refined strings; OpenAI integration optional

---

## ⚡ Features

* Input a draft message
* Refine it to a professional tone
* Loading states and error handling
* Modular, reusable React components
* Clean Controller → Service separation
* Unit tests for backend and frontend

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Backend

1. Navigate to backend:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Run the Spring Boot server:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

3. By default, backend runs on:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

4. Test endpoint manually:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/refine \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text":"This is a test"}'
```

✅ Should return:

```
This is a test (refined)
```

---

### 2️⃣ Frontend

1. Navigate to frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the React app:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Frontend will open at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

5. Enter a draft message and click **Refine** to see the polished version.

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend

Run all tests:

```bash
cd backend
mvn test
```

* **Service Test:** Confirms `RefineService` appends "(refined)"
* **Controller Test:** Confirms `/api/refine` endpoint returns expected response

## 💡 AI Usage Transcript

AI tools (ChatGPT) were used to accelerate development: As I use IntelliJ and VScode for Java and React, I used ChatGPT to keep the Backend and Frontend in the same context.

| Task                     | Example Prompt                                                                                                                 | Purpose                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Generate REST Controller | "Create a Spring Boot REST controller that accepts text input and returns a refined response using a service layer"            | Boilerplate code for `/api/refine` |
| Service Logic            | "Write a Spring Boot service that takes a string input and returns it with '(refined)' appended"                               | Mock AI logic                      |
| React Component          | "Create a modular React component with hooks for input text, button, and result display following standard naming conventions" | Clean frontend UI                  |
| Testing                  | "Write a JUnit test for the Spring Boot service that verifies the string is refined"                                           | Ensure backend logic correctness   |
| Frontend API             | "Write a separate service module in React to call the backend REST API"                                                        | Modular and scalable API calls     |

## 🔧 Notes & Tradeoffs

* **Mocked AI**: Used `(refined)` string instead of real OpenAI API for simplicity and speed
* **CORS** enabled for frontend (`@CrossOrigin`)
* **Security** removed to simplify API access
* Minimal CSS; focus on functionality
* Designed with modular and scalable React structure for future enhancements
